Historically speaking, the Bank of Bombay established in 1840 was the first Commercial Bank in Maharashtra. However, the first commercial bank set up in Maharashtra outside Mumbai was The Poona Bank established in 1889 at Pune followed by The Deccan Bank in 1890 and the Bombay Banking Company in 1898. Outbreak of the FirstWorld War leading to great depression took a heavy toll on banks in India. Between 1914 and 1935 asmany as 380 banks failed in the country out of which 54 were based in Bombay province. The impact ofthese failures was felt more in Maharashtra region because certain banks known for a long time werealso closed down. The effects of great depression started fading and new enterprises began emerging with new hopes in all spheres of economy, including banking.",

In fact, such was the extent of pride felt by sir sorabji pochkhanawala that he proclaimed central bank of india as the 'property of the nation and the country's asset'. He also added that 'central bank of india lives on people's faith and regards itself as the people' own bank'. During the past 109 years of history the bank has weathered many storms and faced many challenges. The bank could successfully transform every threat into business opportunity and excelled over its peers in the banking industry. A number of innovative and unique banking activities have been launched by central bank of india.",

Maharashtra has been a progressive region and the banking activity was also started in this region quite early. Historically speaking, the bank of bombay established in 1840 was the first commercial bank in maharashtra. However, the first commercial bank set up in maharashtra outside mumbai was the poona bank established in 1889 at pune followed by the deccan bank in 1890 and the bombay banking company in 1898. Outbreak of the first world war leading to great depression took a heavy toll on banks in india. Between 1914 and 1935 as many as 380 banks failed in the country out of which 54 were based in bombay province. The impact of these failures was felt more in maharashtra region because certain banks known for a long time were also closed down. The effects of great depression started fading and new enterprises began emerging with new hopes in all spheres of economy, including banking.",
